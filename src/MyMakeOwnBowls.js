                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p> 1 head cauliflower<br />
                    1 chicken breast, diced<br />
                    1 cup  peas<br />
                    1 cup  carrot<br />
                    2 tablespoons  soy sauce<br />
                    2 teaspoons  black pepper<br />
                    3 eggs, beaten<br />
                    2 tablespoons  sesame seed
                </p>

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets. Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture. Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy. Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired.</li>
                  <li>In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the chicken until no pink is showing.</li>
                  <li>Add the peas, carrots, soy sauce, and black pepper.</li>
                  <li>Stir until most of the liquid has reduced, then add the cauliflower rice. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables and chicken are incorporated evenly into the cauliflower.</li>
                  <li>Spread the rice towards the edge of the pan, creating a well in the center. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked.</li>
                  <li>Fold the eggs into the rice, then mix in the sesame seeds.</li>
                </ol>
